# Adventures_in_MachineLearning
A playground for all projects I plan to do related to Machine Learning and Data Science
As of right now, the included and pushed files work as kind of a CLI interface that records your speech, turns into text, and we use IBM's Watson NLU for detecting the sentiment and said sentiment's score. 

As for thr recorder.py file, it has been modified so that it stops recording when it detects a long pause. The duration of the pause can be changed manually in the recorder.py file. 

Coming in the next few days :-
    By the next few days, I hope to finish working out a UI for the app, as well as use Flask/Django so as to record and store multiple       recorded files for the purpose of building a graph of the emotions and their scores displayed during each recording, as well as a         grand avergae. Hopefully, this will be fully finished by the end of April
